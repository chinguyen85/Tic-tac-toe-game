# Tic-tac-toe-game
This game is very popular and even fun to build as a Python project.

The game: It is a two-player game with a nine - square grid. At each opportunity, each player chooses their move and marks their square one with an O or an X. The player who makes all of their marks in a single line, whether diagonally, horizontally, or vertically, wins. The objective for the other player is to both block the game and construct their chain.

We aimed to create an outstanding game that can be played multiply and display the winner along with a visually appealing UI experience.
